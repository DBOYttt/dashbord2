## Lessons Learned

While creating this project I learned how to:
- create pages using `html` , `css` and `php`
- how to fetch data from `SQL` server using php
- how to change data in `Sql` tables using `php`
- `php` loop
- `php` sorting
- `php` create files
- I found out that in `php` files I can store `html`
- `css` how it works in the basic sense
- I noticed that most programs can be made in a small number of files and if additional files are needed, you can create them using the code
